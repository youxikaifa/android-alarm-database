# Introduction #

Any applications may use events, generated by Smart Alarm Clock for their own purporses.
For example, News Feed application may show breaking news few minutes after SOFT\_ALARM\_ALERT.

## Pre-alarm alert ##
**com.android.alarmclock.PRE\_ALARM\_ALERT** will be broadcasted 30-45 minutes before deadline. If user has enabled automatic Aiplane mode during the night, wi-fi will be enabled at this point allowing applications to prepare for the real alarm.

## Soft Alarm Alert ##
**com.android.alarmclock.SOFT\_ALARM\_ALERT** is broadcasted when Smart Alarm Clock has decided to wake user up. This time is the best guess based on the analysis.
Increasing alarm sound will go off at this point and phone vibration will be enabled a bit later.

## Alarm Alert ##
Broadcast of original system alarmclock broadcasted event, **com.android.alarmclock.ALARM\_ALERT** will be suppressed by Smart Alarm Clock in future versions.
